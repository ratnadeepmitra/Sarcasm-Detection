# Sarcasm Detection

This project is part of ANLY-580 coursework at Georgetown University.

Sarcasm detection is a prevalent linguistic phenomenon. Detection of sarcasm is of great importance and it is beneficial to many NLP applications, such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining and advertising. The goal of this research is to use Deep Learning with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) â€“ more specifically Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) networks that classifies tweets as sarcastic or not.
